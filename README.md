## What is it?
EmicoBot is a Twitch chat bot designed for [Emico Mirari's Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/emicomirari). Other chat bots exist, but oftentimes a lot of their features are locked behind a premium paywall. EmicoBot exists to gain full control over the bot and its commands, allowing for deeper chat integration and engagement.

## Commands (WIP)
| Command | Output |
| ------- | ------ |
| !socials | Link to Emico's carrd website containing all of her socials.
| !discord | Link to Emico's discord. |
| !contraption \[user\] | Send a user to THE CONTRAPTION™! (This is a gimmick command with no negative outcome) |


## Can I add it to my channel?
For now, EmicoBot is specific to Emico Mirari's stream, with no plans to make the bot public. However, most of the code is free and open-source in this repository under the MIT license.
